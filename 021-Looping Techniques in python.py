1-Using enumerate():
    enumerate() is used to loop through the containers printing the
    index number along with the value present in that particular index.

2-Using zip():
    zip() is used to combine 2 similar containers(list-list or dict-dict)
    printing the values sequentially. The loop exists only till the smaller container ends.


3-Using items():
    items() performs the similar task on dictionary as iteritems()
    but have certain disadvantages when compared with iteritems().

4-Using sorted():
    sorted() is used to print the container is sorted order. It doesnâ€™t sort the container,
    but just prints the container in sorted order for 1 instance.
    Use of set() can be combined to remove duplicate occurrences.

5-Using reversed():
    reversed() is used to print the values of container in the descending order as declared.
